# recruitment-task
for Predica

What was used: HTML5, CSS3, SCSS, VanillaJS, jQuery, Bootstrap, Google Geolocation API, AJAX, JSON, and possibly something else.
I worked with: Atom, Command Prompt with Ruby, Chrome dev Tools, Firefox Dev Tools, Coffee ;)

Normaly I would not use Bootstrap, but since there are additional points for that...

SCSS was compiled and compressed.

Just to show off ;)
