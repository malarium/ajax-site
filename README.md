# ajax-site
for practise

What was used: HTML5, CSS3, SCSS, VanillaJS, jQuery, Bootstrap, Google Geolocation API, AJAX, JSON, and possibly something else.
I worked with: Atom, Command Prompt with Ruby, Chrome dev Tools, Firefox Dev Tools, Coffee ;)

Normaly I would not use Bootstrap, but it is still popular for some reason...

SCSS was compiled and compressed.
